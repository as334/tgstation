changes: 
  - balance: "epinephrine no longer hard caps oxygen damage at ~30"
  - balance: "epinephrine now gives the no crit damage trait, which makes creatures not take passive oxygen(or brute if you cant breathe) damage while in critical"
  - tweak: "epinephrine now heals minor oxygen damage at the same health threshold that it currently heals other damage types at."
  - bugfix: "atropine and epinephrine now check if your health is under your mobs crit threshold instead of using the number 0 before healing"
